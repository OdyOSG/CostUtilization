\value{
An S3 object of class \code{costCovariateSettings}.
}
\description{
Creates a single, unified settings object for constructing cost and utilization covariates. This function can
define analyses using standard "long/medium/short-term" windows, fully custom temporal windows, or a combination of both.
}
\details{
This function generates a \code{costCovariateSettings} object that can be passed to the
\code{getDbCovariateData} function.

To use standard windows, set flags like \code{useCostTotalLongTerm = TRUE}.
To use custom windows, provide a list to \code{customTemporalWindows}, e.g., \code{list(c(-30, -1), c(0, 0))}.
Any analyses selected (e.g., \code{useCostTotalLongTerm = TRUE}) will be applied to all custom windows as well.
