Description: Provides a framework for executing standardized cost and healthcare
    utilization analyses on the OMOP Common Data Model. This package computes
    aggregated or person-level cost and utilization metrics across various
    domains (e.g., Drug, Visit) and temporal windows relative to a cohort.
    The primary output is a `CostCovariateData` object, which can be summarized,
    plotted, and used in downstream OHDSI study pipelines.
