Description: Provides a framework for executing standardized cost and
    healthcare utilization analyses on the OMOP Common Data Model. This
    package computes aggregated or person-level cost and utilization
    metrics across various domains (e.g., Drug, Visit) and temporal
    windows relative to a cohort.  The primary output is a
    `CostCovariateData` object, which can be summarized, plotted, and used
    in downstream OHDSI study pipelines.
