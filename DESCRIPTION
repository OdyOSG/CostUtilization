Description: Calculates costs for specified patient cohorts within the OMOP CDM framework. This package allows users to compute costs based on various 
    dimensions such as cost concepts (e.g., allowed, paid) and cost types (provenance), and optionally filter by clinical events. The output 
    conforms to the FeatureExtraction package's object model, facilitating seamless integration into existing OHDSI study pipelines.
