Description: Provides a framework for executing standardized cost and
    healthcare utilization analyses on the OMOP Common Data Model. This
    package computes aggregated or person-level cost and utilization
    metrics across various domains (e.g., Drug, Visit) and temporal
    windows relative to a cohort. The primary output includes cost
    metrics (per-person-per-month, total costs) and utilization rates
    (visits per 1000 person-years) that can be used in downstream
    OHDSI study pipelines.
